                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Technology in Cybersecurity. Throughout my
                        education, I have learned multiple coding languages, mathematics, good organization, and
                        effective communication. I read the job description on your website with great interest. I am
                        excited by the opportunity to grow my understanding and skills at a company whose core values
                        are rooted in service, professionalism, and taking pride in oneâ€™s work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My experience with multiple coding languages, a strong understanding of mathematics,
                        organizational skills, and strong English. As a student, I have completed calculus one and
                        university physics and learned multiple different coding languages including HTML, CSS, Java,
                        C++, and Python. At EMS Barcode Solutions, I learned how to effectively communicate with
                        coworkers and clients face-to-face, over the phone, through virtual meetings, and emails. I also
                        have strong analytical and organizational skills. All these attributes are why I believe I am a
                        strong fit for the Encore Summer 2021 technical intern.
